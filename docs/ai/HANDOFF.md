# Frigo AI Handoff — isolated T08 checkpoint

## Current branch handoff (publication rechecked 2026-09-10)

Repository vn-2c/Frigo reconfirmed. Trusted canonical publish of b5577ea denied
again; no remote canonical branch/open PR exists. Source is identical to dd2ecc6.
Only Git/diff checks ran this session; prior test evidence below was not rerun.
FULL SUITE NOT RUN IN THIS SESSION. No alternative branch is authorized yet.

Program: Inventory Truth Layer
Task: T08
Phase: T08F Verification/Handoff
Status: IN_PROGRESS — local gates passed, canonical publication BLOCKED
Canonical Branch: feature/t08-inventory-truth-foundation
Base Main / last fetched origin/main: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa
Last Code / Last Verified SHA: dd2ecc6f7066250dfdc5214a3d6c356e1479b61e
Final HEAD: subsequent docs-only checkpoint; read `git rev-parse HEAD`

Completed: audit; strict storage/lot contracts; additive 0023; exact milli-unit
adapter; explicit guarded/idempotent backfill; compatibility projection/parity.
Verification: 130 focused tests; 1,617 full tests / 89 files; lint, typecheck,
build, 23-migration replay/local D1 apply/schema and diff checks PASS.
Failures: early assertion order/missing legacyVersion/latest-migration expectation
corrected and all gates rerun; publication denial remains unresolved.

Remaining / exact next action: obtain authorization to publish ONLY canonical
branch through the trusted source-control broker, inspect its remote head, publish
the docs-inclusive tip with lease, confirm clean tree and create final T08 report.
Do not push a substitute branch, force-push, merge/rebase main or begin T09.
Quantity that cannot fit exact milli-units fails preflight unchanged. Legacy data
is not live-synced; unknown/estimated evidence stays distinct and guest transfer
drift is diagnostic, not an auth rewrite. T09 owns commands/event authority/dual-write.

Cross-account takeover: first read the six `inventory-truth/` documents in order;
diff Last Verified SHA..HEAD. Exact executed commands, corrected failures, source
map and future integration risks are persisted there, not dependent on this chat.
Branch pushed: NO. Main/production/staging/remote D1/PayOS untouched: YES.

PRODUCTION: **NOT DEPLOYED**

## Current status

T01-T07: COMPLETE

Release Integration: **COMPLETE**

Main Integration: **COMPLETE**

GitHub source of truth: main.

APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.

The main merge tree is source-equivalent to the verified release head. Changes
after the production application base are documentation-only.

## Verification receipt

- Full: 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS.
- Focused T02-T07: 819 tests / 40 files PASS.
- D1 clean: 22 / 22 migrations PASS.
- Upgrade sanity: 0020 -> 0022 PASS.
- Existing rows preserved: 776 rows / 58 tables.
- Browser: 264 assertions / 36 phases PASS.
- Payment-adjacent: 82 tests / 7 files PASS.
- Final release CI: PASS.

These are preserved application gates and were not rerun during this docs-only
reconciliation. The previous documentation cleanup PR's hosted checks passed;
this correction PR will receive its own hosted check.

## Deployment and production boundary

Release packaging completed. Staging was not provisioned, so no staging deploy
occurred; staging build, deploy and smoke steps were skipped. Production job was
skipped and production deployment was not performed.

PRODUCTION LOCAL RECONCILIATION NOT STARTED

Production local reconciliation: NOT STARTED

PRODUCTION DATABASE MIGRATION NOT PERFORMED

Production DB migration: NOT PERFORMED

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT NOT PERFORMED

Production deployment: NOT PERFORMED

Planner rollout: NOT STARTED. Checked-in planner/UI/AI safe defaults remain
according to rollout policy; live production values and secrets were not
inspected.

## PR #8 authoritative metadata

PR #8 METADATA:

- State: `MERGED`
- Draft: `false`
- Merged at: `2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`
- Closed at: `2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`
- Merge commit: `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`
- Base: `main`
- Head: `hoplite/kirrha-5f4057f0`
- Head SHA: `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`

PR #8 was not reopened, re-merged or modified during this task. Its verified
release tree is already contained in main. Application integration and PR
metadata are separate facts.

## Kirrha archival state

Kirrha is two commits ahead of current main and differs only in the four
`docs/ai/` release protocol documents. It has no application differences absent
from main. Do not merge or revert this historical branch.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

## Next task

Next task: PRODUCTION-LOCAL RECONCILIATION

Do NOT git pull/reset directly inside running production. Production-local source
must first be snapshotted and compared against the final post-merge GitHub main
head, with
application lineage anchored at `PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA`. Do not deploy,
run remote migrations, enable planner flags or alter production configuration as
part of this bookkeeping task. Do not treat `PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD` as the final
head.
